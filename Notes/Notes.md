# Typescript

## Overview of Typescript

Typescript is simply javascript with a type system, which is what we're going to
spend most of the course learning

The goal of the type system is to catch errors during development

TS uses type annotations to analyze the code, and is only active during
development

Important to note TS does not offer any meaningful performance optimization

## How the course will go

We will write some TS code

When we're ready to run our code we will feed it to a typescript compiler to get
raw js

Once we have the raw js we will execute that in Node/Browser

## In short...

Writing TS is just like writing JS with extra documentation

TS has no effect on how code gets run by the browser or by node

Best to think of TS as a friend that is sitting behind you while you're coding
